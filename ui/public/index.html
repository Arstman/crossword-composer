		<h1>Crossword Constructor</h1>

		<div id="app-root"></div>

		<p><strong>How to use:</strong> click squares in the grid above to toggle
		between filled and blank squares. Then, hit “Start“ to start the filler.
		If the filler is slow, it is having trouble finding a combination of words
		that works with the pattern you provided. You can either give it time (but 
		keep in mind not all grids have a solution!), or add more filled-in squares
		to make its job easier.
		</p>

		<p>You can leave the filler turned on as you modify the grid to see updates
			as quickly as the filler can operate. Just keep in mind that filling
			a crossword can be computationally intensive, so if you are on battery
			it's better not to leave it running as you edit.
